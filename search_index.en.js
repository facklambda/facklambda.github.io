made leaps and bounds of progress on this project once I decided to start a bit smaller!\nRather than being a bit over-ambitious, which is learning rust without much foundation on a relatively new embedded system (ESP32-C3) with relatively little documentation (it's vastly improved since my last blog post). I readjusted my ambitions and settled on a more realistic goal of getting it all to run on a raspberry pi.\n\nParts list so far:\n\nESP32-C3\nRaspberry Pi 2b+ (running raspbian)\nstring of 25 WS2812b LEDs\n25 glass bottles\na milk crate\n3 dupont wires\n\n\nAfter spending a few months hoarding glass beverage bottles, I finally amassed the proper amount of correctly sized bottles to fit a 5 by 5 grid in the milk crate. Cutting the daisychained strip of 50 WS2812b LEDs in half and placing one of each of the 25 LEDs into the mouth of each bottle was very simple. Hooking them up to the raspberry pi also proved to be simple, just direct connect the corresponding wires to a 5v pin, a SPI GPIO pin, and a ground pin.\nThe Code:\nI'm pretty new to writing rust code, and embedded electronics, but I have a basic knowledge of most concepts involved. I again had to recalibrate my expectations for this project. There's no way I'm going to get up and running very quickly if I try to code this all myself, so I'm leaning heavily on Philipp Schuster's very simple ws281x led driver rust code. This got me up and running with a nice set of examples and demo code that I could rely on for a quick dopamine rush (I particularly like the way the pulsating square demo looks).\nAs of writing this post, beerlicht's published code still just a repo containing Philipp's code.\nNext steps for this project will be writing the networking code and the logic that lights each light up based on network activity.\ngreetz to Philipp, V, and all my friends who've been subjected to me showing this off.\n","id":"https://facklambda.dev/five/","title":"beerlicht pt 2"},"https://facklambda.dev/four/":{"body":"I've started on a fun little art project based losely off of noisebridge's Flaschen Taschen and c-base's Mate-Light.\nMy twist on the project is that it will be an ambient light that reacts to traffic on the local network (and maybe even the wide area network).\n\nParts list so far:\n\nESP32-C3\nstring of 25 WS2812b LEDs\n25 glass bottles\na milk crate\n3 dupont wires\n\n\ngreetz to Philipp, V, and all my friends who've been subjected to me showing this off.\n","id":"https://facklambda.dev/four/","title":"beerlicht"},"https://facklambda.dev/one/":{"body":"\n'Hello, friend?\" That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It's actually happened. I'm talking to an imaginary person. What I'm about to tell you is top secret. A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I'm talking about the guys no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top one percent of the top one percent. The guys that play God without permission. And now I think they're following me.\n\n\nSo, this is my first blog post. Pretty damn underwhelming I'll tell ya what... My goals for this project are to attempt to maintain an average of 1 blog post per day, about either my thoughts on politics, news, projects, and problems I feel are worthy of writing about.\nIt should be worth noting that I've been hyping myself up to make a public blog for about 4 years now. Unfortunately I have a habit letting my perfectionism get the best of me, and allowing myself to procrastinate things indefinitely. I realized I needed to just bite the bullet and get this thing started.\nSo here I am, starting a blog post with a quote from the first episode of one of my favorite TV series, Mr. Robot. I've consumed a lot of media during the quarantine, and I've finally hit the point where I'm completely bored of that. I definitely feel the urge to just create something, anything. And at this point a blog post is probably the least embarrasing online presence I can curate. \nStay tuned for more.\n\ngreetz to v, kurt, jo, j3s, vvesley, nyx, junk, nildicit, kaworu, shoggoth, starless, cass, forest, aimless, mc_crash, skh, twitter mufos, and the cyberia.club crew\nfuckingz to anyone that refuses to wear a mask\n","id":"https://facklambda.dev/one/","title":"hello, friend."},"https://facklambda.dev/seven/":{"body":"I rewatched Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb along with my partner and a close friend, neither of which had seen the movie before. The movie satirizes the bureaucratic, process oriented mindset of cold war era politicians and military men, and remains both prescient and relevant to this day. There's a scene in the movie where the great men are panicking over a percieved \"mineshaft gap\". Many actions in the cold war were driven by the paranoid minds in charge of the military-industrial-inferiority complex. Every percieved advantage the other side had was deemed a \"gap\", in the movie we watch them decry the \"missile gap\", the \"doomsday machine gap\", and finally the \"mineshaft gap\".\nMind the gap...\n\nI'd like to preface this by saying I'm not trying to make any argument or convince any reader to change their outlooks, I just wanted to write down the way I've observed things play out during the pandemic. I'm writing for writing's own sake. I'm not trying to make this a screed for or against anyone's particular level of risk aversion. I just want to jot down an idle thought I had sometime last year, that has been rattling around in my head ever since. By now, if you know me IRL, you should understand where I land on this topic.\nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic has drawn on, my friends and I have naturally segregated into our own little groups, each of which exhibiting varying levels of precautionary measures. Personally, I'm willing to adapt to my most cautious friend's requirements, despite my own opinions that N95 masks and ventilation/air filtration are sufficient, I know people who have been uncomfortable hanging out without covid tests and short quarantines beforehand. Thankfully, my partner and I are capable of accomodating these friends. Unfortunately this causes me to be somewhat discriminating of when/where I hang out with friends who are less cautious.\nThe night of watching Dr Strangelove, much adult beverages were consumed, and our friend was inebriated enough to take up our offer to crash on our couch rather than venture home. Our friend woke up the next day and shared with us a humorous dream they had: It was that I had made an announcement at the end of the night that I had already been ill with covid nearly a year earlier.\nI believe my friend was cut short from finishing their thoughts either by my own questioning about what to have for breakfast, or our collective laughter. But I assumed the conclusion was that I was just keeping up appearances to be able to maintain actively hanging out with my friend. I thought that was very cute and endearing, but I'm confident I would have told my friends if I was ill with covid, and it wouldn't change my level of caution towards the disease. As an aside, thankfully neither my partner nor I have caught covid roughly 3 years into this global pandemic, and I'm somewhat proud of that. But it brought to mind my previous thoughts of how during the course of this pandemic maybe we've all been collectively matching our own social circle's expectations of safety.\nSimilar to the \"mineshaft gap\"; I wondered if there was some element of \"runaway\" precautionary measures, so to say? And if that's the case, is there also the inverse reaction of throwing caution to the wind? These two things are somewhat incompatible in the sense that overlap between the groups cannot exist cohesively. Are my more cautious friends actually cautious because they perceive me as being cautious and am I more cautions because I perceive my friends as more cautious... ad infinitum... ? Are people who throw caution to the wind only doing so because people in their social circle are throwing caution to the wind, yadda yadda yadda... Maybe I have just fixated on a tiny cultural signifier here, which is actually just a microcosm how how societies and social groupings naturally arrange themselves? Some folks might've been coerced in some ways to participate in social groupins they themselves haven't chosen, the same way the B-52 crewmen were ordered to execute Wing Attack Plan R. Or maybe some folks enthusiasticaly embraced their assigned social grouping similary to Major T. J. Kong.\nIf you've found yourself reading this with a similar expression as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake to Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, and saying \"I don't follow\", then you're probably in good company, thanks for reading.\n","id":"https://facklambda.dev/seven/","title":"mineshaft gap"},"https://facklambda.dev/six/":{"body":"I've recently been working on a fun project that should be a useful general-utility CLI app that can parse GTFS data for arbitrary transit providers (so long as they publish GTFS data!). I would like to roll this project into a bigger one for displaying timestables on an actual display.\n\nThe project is currently named 'bust' which is a bit crass, but I like it so I'm sticking with it for the time being.\nCurrently the major dependencies of the app are gtfs_structure and clap. I will likely need to write some code that will be heavily reliant on reqwest in order to implement a feature that polls transit provider specific APIs (in this case, metrotransit's nextripv2 api).\nCurrently I'm facing a problem with parsing the gtfs data in a timely manner. On my Raspberry Pi it takes about 30 seconds to parse the gtfs data into structs and the print out statistics regarding them. I believe this can be fine tuned, but don't know exactly how at this time.\ngreetz to fellow bus riding friends, the strange amount of european transit app developers who like to use Rust, my partner V for putting up with my rubber duck debugging\n","id":"https://facklambda.dev/six/","title":"bust"},"https://facklambda.dev/three/":{"body":"I've moved.
